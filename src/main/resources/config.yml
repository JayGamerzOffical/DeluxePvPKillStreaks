# This configuration allows you to fully customize the messages & behavior of the plugin.

# Available PlaceholderAPI placeholders:
# %killstreak_current% - Current killstreak of the player
# %killstreak_player_best% - Best (highest) killstreak achieved by the player (persistent across restarts)
# %killstreak_top_player% - Name of the player with the highest current killstreak
# %killstreak_top_streak% - The highest current killstreak on the server

# Note: Best killstreaks are automatically saved to a SQLite database (killstreaks.db)
# and will persist across server restarts. Current killstreaks are reset on restart.
